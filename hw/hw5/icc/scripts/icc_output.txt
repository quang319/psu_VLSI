   Data Types
       num          integer
       nets         collection

ARGUMENTS
       -max_detail_route_iterations num
              Specifies the maximum number of detail routing iterations.   You
              can specify an integer between 1 and 1000.

              By  default,  the  maximum  number  of iterations for the detail
              routing command (40) is used.

       -nets nets
              Specifies the nets to be routed.

              You must specify the nets on which to run this command by speci-
              fying   at   least   one   of   the  following  options:  -nets,
              -all_clock_nets, and -from_file. The -nets  and  -all_clock_nets
              options  are  mutually  exclusive; you can specify only one. You
              can specify the -from_file  option  in  addition  to  the  -nets
              option.

       -all_clock_nets
              Routes all clock nets.

              You must specify the nets on which to run this command by speci-
              fying  at  least  one   of   the   following   options:   -nets,
              -all_clock_nets,    and   -from_file.   If   you   specify   the
              -all_clock_nets  option,  you  cannot  specify  the   -nets   or
              -from_file option.

       -stop_after_global_route true | false
              Controls  whether  the router stops after global routing or con-
              tinues all the way to detail routing.

              The default value is false, which means that the router  contin-
              ues all the way to detail routing.

       -reuse_existing_global_route true | false
              Enables (true) or disables (false) incremental global routing.

              By  default  (false),  the  global  router  deletes all existing
              global routes from the design before routing starts.

              If you set this option to true,  the  global  router  keeps  and
              reuses the existing global routes.

       -utilize_dangling_wires true | false
              Controls  whether  the router tries to reuse the dangling routes
              as much as possible.

              The default value is true.

       -exploration true | false
              Specifies what routing quality the router should use for  global
              routing.

              By  default (false), the router routes the design in normal mode
              and uses higher effort to reduce congestion.

              If you set this option to true, the global  router  ignores  the
              blockages  on  blocked  pins  when  routing the design and makes
              other simplifying assumptions in order to complete global  rout-
              ing  quickly.  Designs  can  be unlegalized in exploration mode.
              Exploration mode will also disable timing or cross  talk  driven
              routing.   The  resulting  congestion  map shows the location of
              congestion hot  spots  in  the  floorplan.  Absolute  congestion
              statistics  might  differ  from  the normal global router, espe-
              cially if the design is not clean.  Exploration mode is intended
              to be used only in floorplan exploration or design planning. Its
              purpose is to give a quick picture of floorplan routing problems
              as  a guide for placement improvements. You should not run track
              assignment or detail routing based on  exploration  mode  global
              routing.  If  you  do  not also set the -stop_after_global_route
              true option when you enable exploration mode,  the  router  sets
              this  option  automatically  and issues an error indicating that
              exploration mode global routing should not be  used  for  detail
              routing.

       -from_file file_name
              Routes the nets specified by name in the file.

              If  the specified file either does not exist or does not contain
              any valid nets, the tool generates an error  and  indicates  the
              source of the problem.

              You must specify the nets on which to run this command by speci-
              fying  at  least  one   of   the   following   options:   -nets,
              -all_clock_nets,  and -from_file. You can specify the -from_file
              option in addition to the -nets; however, the -from_file  option
              cannot be used with the -all_clock_nets option.

DESCRIPTION
       The route_zrt_group command is used to route a specified group of nets.

   Multicorner-Multimode Support
       This command uses information from all active scenarios.

EXAMPLES
       The following command performs routing for all  clock  nets  using  the
       -max_detail_route_iterations and -utilize_dangling_wires options.

         prompt> route_zrt_group -all_clock_nets \
            -max_detail_route_iterations 6 \
            -utilize_dangling_wires true
